# Install or remove Windows Widgets
A batch script to remove and install Widgets on Windows 11 (Should also work on Windows 10 but I didn't try it).

Just run "widget_remove.bat" or "widget_install.bat" as administrator then reboot to remove or install Widgets on Windows. Requires internet coonection to install Widgets.
